# persistence

A new Flutter project.

We have to use the path_provider flutter plugin to persist data via filing https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider. 

We have use the todo app tutorial that we built in class and extend it with this logic to persist the data.

To save files to disk on mobile or desktop apps, combine the path_provider plugin with the dart:io library.

This recipe uses the following steps:

1- Find the correct local path.\
2- Create a reference to the file location.\
3- Write data to the file.\
4- Read data from the file.
